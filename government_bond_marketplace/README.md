# Government Bond Marketplace
This is the user interface of the whole application. It's a very simple Next.js application with three pages.

## Running the app
1. Run the following command `npm install`
2. Run the following command `npm run dev` to get the application running

## Troubleshooting
- If the application is taking too long to load then ensure the `BACKEND_URL` in the `./.env.local` file is correct.
The URL should represent the port the application `/governmentBackend` is running on.
- node `v21.7.3` was used when developing.
